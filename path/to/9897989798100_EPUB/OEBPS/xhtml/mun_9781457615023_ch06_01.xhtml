<p class="noindent">Turnertronics Biomedical Systems (TBS) offers a line of anesthesia machines and monitoring devices for use in surgery and critical care. Anesthesia machines deliver medical gases to patients at a preselected mixture, pressure, and flow rate. Widely used in a variety of clinical settings, TBS&#8217;s monitoring devices capture and display patients&#8217; vital measurements such as heart rhythm, blood pressure, and level of oxygen in blood (<b><a href="#fig_6_1">Figure 6.1</a></b>).</p>

<p class="indent">The mission of TBS is to provide the most cost-effective and innovative biomedical equipment to the medical community. Key to achieving this mission is the company&#8217;s Priti all-in-one monitoring systems. Used by anesthesia providers to both interpret patients&#8217; conditions and implement various treatments during care, the Priti monitors offer rapid measurements of all vital signs along with an easy-to-use touch screen.</p>
<p class="indent">TBS engineers are currently developing the next generation of Priti monitoring devices: the Turnertronics Priti5 All-in-One Anesthesia Monitoring System. Currently, the Priti5 exists as an early-stage prototype &#8212; so early, in fact, that the user interface design is still under development. For now, the engineers have provided you with a &#8220;best-guess&#8221; sketch of how the interface might look. Later, engineers will develop a touch-screen interface for the Priti5. As the company&#8217;s documentation specialist, you are responsible for producing the documentation for the Priti5.</p>

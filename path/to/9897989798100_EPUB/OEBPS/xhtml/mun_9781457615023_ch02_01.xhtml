<p class="noindent">When Mary Ann Petit, a neighbor of yours and the founder of Bayside United Green Squad (BUGS), learned of your technical communication background, she asked you to help with her community group. BUGS is a nonprofit volunteer group that offers environmental programs designed to teach young people ages 10 to 16 about the connections between environmental issues and food. Using a community garden as a learning lab, BUGS volunteers provide local youth with hands-on science education on environmental issues affecting the local food they eat. To better reach their target audience, the board of directors has decided to enhance the BUGS Web site by including a blog.</p>
<p class="indent">Mary Ann explains that the success of BUGS has created not only a desire among program graduates to stay in touch, but also a demand for information on how young people can grow, harvest, prepare, and eat vegetables from their own backyard gardens. To address these demands, Mary Ann would like you to help start a blog to facilitate communication among young gardeners. By providing a mechanism for instructors and program graduates to comment on posts, Mary Ann hopes to build an online community.</p>

<p class="indent">Although another volunteer will provide the technical skills to design the blog, Jenny Ukaegbu, the BUGS blogger, asks for your help writing some of the content for the initial blog posts, especially definitions and descriptions of gardening and blogging terms to help the group members understand how to effectively use and contribute to the blog. &#8220;In our first couple of blog posts,&#8221; Jenny explains, &#8220;we need to teach the young gardeners a little about blogging and get them excited about reading our blog and posting comments&#8212;and we also need to start teaching them about backyard gardening.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" title="16" id="page16" />Depending on the context, the blog posts will use parenthetical and sentence definitions as well as descriptions to help youth understand and succeed at blogging and gardening. Parenthetical definitions are placed directly in the text. When a simple word or phrase is not enough, the blog posts will feature pop-up sentence definitions for more formal clarification. Jenny shows you an example of two parenthetical definitions, one for <i>post</i> and one for <i>blogroll</i>, as well as a sentence definition for <i>phytoremediation</i> (<a href="#fig_2_2"><b>Figure 2.2</b></a>).</p>

<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Parenthetical Definitions:</p>
<p>With summer&#8217;s growing season approaching, how about finding creative ways to enjoy your backyard garden? In this post (an individual entry in a blog), I provide tips for fun summer garden activities. For more ideas, be sure to check our blogroll, a list of links to other blogs, on the right sidebar.</p>
<p>The label reads as follows: The definition for post is enclosed in parentheses, and the definition for blogroll is enclosed in commas. Parenthetical definitions can also be introduced with a colon or a dash.</p>
<p>Sentence Definition:</p>
<p>Phytoremediation is a cleanup technology (the words &#8220;cleanup technology&#8221; are double underlined) using living plants (the words &#8220;living plants&#8221; are dashed underlined) to remove or detoxify environmental contaminants from soil and water.</p>
<p>The label reads as follows: The item to be defined (phytoremediation) is placed in a group of similar items (the phrase &#8220;group of similar items&#8221; are double underlined) and then distinguished from them by stating the key distinction (the words &#8220;key distinction&#8221; are dashed underlined) between the item being defined and the other items in the group.</p>

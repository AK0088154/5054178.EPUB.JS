<p class="noindent">After you have evaluated the proposals (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch04_04.xhtml#fig_4_2"><b>Documents 4.2</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch04_04.xhtml#fig_4_3"><b>4.3</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch04_04.xhtml#fig_4_4"><b>4.4</b></a> and <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch04_04.xhtml#fig_4_5"><b>4.5</b></a>), meet with three or four other reviewers. Discuss the proposals, and reach a consensus on each proposal: whether it should be funded and, if so, what monetary award should be given. Jessica is also interested in the effectiveness of the proposal-review process. After reaching a consensus, hold a short debriefing session in which you consider the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>How did you read each proposal? Did you read in a linear fashion from top to bottom, or did you skip around and read sections out of order? Did you skim or skip any parts?</li>
<li>In what ways did each reviewer&#8217;s background, personal beliefs, and interpretation of the evaluation criteria affect funding decisions?</li>
<li>What aspects of the content, organization, and design of the proposals made reviewing them difficult? What made the task easier?</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Jessica would like to offer proposal writers some advice on the Heathcot-Lynn Web site. Based on your discussion and experience as a reviewer, provide advice on how to write a successful proposal. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about building a Web page. Just email me a document with the content designed the way you want it to look online, and include notes to our Web designer regarding any additional online features you want included, such as links.&#8221;</p>

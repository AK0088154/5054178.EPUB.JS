<ul class="bullet">
<li>Study a preface to a technical report to learn the characteristics of the organization&#8217;s reports.</li>
<li>Contrast a printed report to a report designed for online use, and evaluate their features.</li>
<li>Learn about appropriate content and level of detail for an energy report.</li>
<li>Use the organization&#8217;s style guide to answer writing-related questions posed by analysts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Your instructor will tell you which of the tasks you are to complete.</p>

<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Reflecting on This Case</b> In a 250- to 500-word response to your instructor, discuss (a) what you learned from this case, (b) how you could relate this case to work situations you will face in your chosen career, and, if applicable, (c) the ways in which this case compares to similar situations you have already faced at work. Your instructor will tell you whether your response should be submitted as a memo, an email, or a journal entry, or in a different format.</p>
<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Moving beyond This Case</b> Locate a professional who spends a significant amount of his or her time writing at work and is willing to be interviewed. You may choose to interview someone from your chosen field or a different profession. Investigate how this professional learned about writing for his or her particular organization. You might ask the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>What types of documents do you regularly write for your employer?</li>
<li>How did writing in college differ from writing in your organization?</li>
<li>What did you need to learn about writing in your organization? How did you go about learning it?</li>
<li>Did anyone within the organization help you? If so, who, and in what ways did they help?</li>
<li>What advice do you have for new employees learning to write?</li>
</ul>
<p class="bx_noindent">Present your findings in a report to your instructor.</p>

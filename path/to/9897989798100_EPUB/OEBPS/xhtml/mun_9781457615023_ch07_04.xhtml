<p class="noindent">Burt Krebs, Virginia State Insurance Manager, has created a few slides (<b><a href="#fig_7_2">Documents 7.2</a></b>, <b><a href="#fig_7_3">7.3</a></b>, and <b><a href="#fig_7_4">7.4</a></b>) for the open enrollment meeting presentation using a popular presentation-graphics application. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to use one of the templates because most didn&#8217;t seem to offer a design that would best suit our information, but now I&#8217;m not sure how to design my slides from scratch,&#8221; he explains. <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" title="77" id="page77" />Burt hands you printouts of the slides with notes on them and says, &#8220;Take a look at these and come up with an effective design. The notes explain some of my concerns and suggest some options for design.&#8221; Decide on an overall design for Burt&#8217;s presentation, and apply this design to the slides Burt showed you. Then, in a brief e-mail to Burt, justify your design decisions.</p>

<p>The title reads &#8220;Office of Group Insurance&#8221;</p>
<p>The sub title reads &#8220;Open Enrollment Meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The labels read as follows:</p>
<p>Of course, this looks pretty dull. How can we make this more interesting?</p>
<p>What other information should we add to the title slide?</p>
<p>What type of background should I use? Should I include any images? Animations? Instead of black letters should I use a different color(s)?</p>

<p>The labels read as follows:</p>
<p>How should we improve the design to help our audience understand each slide, the organization of our presentation, and the point the speaker is addressing?</p>
<p>What information, if any, should we place in footer?</p>

<p>The title area is blank.</p>
<p>The text in the object area reads as follows:</p>
<p>Review PPO Provider Directories and if Provider NOT on PPO List, Decide if PPO is Appropriate. Download and print a PDF of Application on Insurance Website. Or, complete your application entirely online.</p>
<p>All Employees Must Re-enroll in Health Insurance Make a Choice between Traditional or PPO Completed Paper Application must be turned in to Agency Payroll Office by 5:00 PM May 28. Agency Payroll Office will enter your Information via IPOPS. Agency Payroll Offices Will Receive a Limited Number of Paper Applications. Supplies are limited.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads: This slide describes what state employees need to do to complete the paper application (although we prefer that they complete the online application instead). I need a title. Also, how can we design this slide to make these steps clearer?</p>

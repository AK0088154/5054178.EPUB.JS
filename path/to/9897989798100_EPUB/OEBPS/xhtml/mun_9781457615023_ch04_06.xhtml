<p class="noindent">The foundation&#8217;s board of directors asks you to write an email to each organization for whose proposal you recommended reduced or no funding (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch04_04.xhtml#fig_4_2"><b>Documents 4.2</b></a> to <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch04_04.xhtml#fig_4_5"><b>4.5</b></a>). Jessica explains, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to discourage these groups. Many of our best proposals come from groups who were first rejected and who then resubmitted revised proposals.&#8221; In your messages, remember to thank the individual for submitting a proposal, explain why the proposal received reduced or no funding, suggest ways of improving the proposal, and, if appropriate, encourage the organization to resubmit the proposal during the next quarter.</p>

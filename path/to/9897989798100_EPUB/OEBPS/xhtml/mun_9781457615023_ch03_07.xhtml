<p class="noindent">Axel shows you his internal memo on the H<sub>2</sub>O Pro-TechT product line (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch03_04.xhtml#fig_3_2"><b>Document 3.2</b></a>) as well as recent customer complaints (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch03_05.xhtml#fig_3_3"><b>Documents 3.3</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch03_06.xhtml#fig_3_5"><b>3.5</b></a>, and <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch03_06.xhtml#fig_3_6"><b>3.6</b></a>). He also shows you copies of a few microblog comments from customers (<b><a href="#fig_3_7">Document 3.7</a></b>) and a blog post (<b><a href="#fig_3_8">Document 3.8</a></b>) from a local climber critical of the store and the product. Axel sighs. Recently, the store has established an online presence with a blog and a microblogging site, and Axel would like your help addressing this customer issue using these Web 2.0 tools. &#8220;I&#8217;d like you to draft one to three microblog posts, no more than 140 characters each, and a longer blog post of about 300 to 500 words. Although I want these to respond specifically to the concerns raised about our H<sub>2</sub>O Pro-TechT line of clothing, I also want to make a strong statement about our overall commitment to our customers. We need to build relationships with customers and establish a positive presence in the blogosphere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gear review of H20 Pro-TechT Jacket</p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;ve been wearing this all season, so it&#8217;s time for a review. I&#8217;ve carried my H20 jacket with me every climbing trip, adding layers underneath depending on conditions. The H20 Pro-TechT waterproof jacket sold by Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters comes with clean styling and multisport versatility. Here&#8217;s the specs: nylon blend fabric, athletic fit, windproof, waterproof, breathable laminate (not), helmet-compatible hood, and thigh length for max coverage, laminated zippers, articulated elbows, convenient Napoleon and upper-arm pockets, and waist cord. Sounds great, right? Not so fast.</p>
<p>I made my almost weekly shopping trip to Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters, looking for a minimalist alpine jacket for use while climbing. According to the sales staff at Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters, &#8220;This jacket will keep you bone-dry in a hurricane.&#8221; I get they are trying to sound enthusiastic and sell me the product, but they just don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about. The staff is a bunch of young college kids in sandals who have never actually been climbing or been caught in a lengthy rainstorm on the side of a mountain. Contrary to the sales pitch, the fabric is NOT breathable. Unless you plan to wear it just while you sit around camp, the jacket is just not suitable. I ended up a clammy mess on most of my climbs. With a layer underneath, I can avoid most of the moisture issues. This seems like a cheap fix for an expensive but flawed product.</p>
<p>Other concerns: That upper-arm pocket: worthless and a pain to open and close. The hood is not helmet adjustable. The main zipper is not waterproof. The lining is starting to delaminate. So, all in all, a big thumbs down for the H20 Pro-TechT jacket and the guy who sold it to me.</p>
<p>I expect more from a jacket in this price range and question whether Onward &#38; Upward should even be selling this product.</p>

<p class="noindent">First, Merilee would like you to learn about EIA, and, in particular, what EIA writers want to accomplish with their energy publications. She suggests that you start by reading &#8220;Our Work&#8221; under the heading &#8220;About EIA&#8221; on the EIA site at <a title="external" href="http://www.eia.gov/about/eia_explained.cfm">www.eia.gov/about/eia_explained.cfm</a> (<b><a href="#fig_5_2">Figure 5.2</a></b>) and explore other links on the site such as &#8220;Mission and Overview&#8221; (<b><a href="#fig_5_3">Figures 5.3</a></b> and <b><a href="#fig_5_4">5.4</a></b>). To introduce you <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" title="51" id="page51" />to EIA publications, Merilee asks you to study a preface (<b><a href="#fig_5_5">Document 5.5</a></b>) and write a two-page memo in which you do the following: (a) describe the preface&#8217;s audience and purpose; (b) evaluate how well the preface explains the subject, purpose, background, and scope of the report; (c) describe and evaluate the preface&#8217;s organizational structure; and (d) discuss the preface&#8217;s level of formality and voice (active or passive). To get you started, Merilee has provided brief marginal notes.</p>

<p>The labels read as follows:</p>
<p>1. At the EIA, we label some of our introductory sections as prefaces and place them in the front matter of the report. Note lowercase Roman numeral pagination (e.g., ix and x). Other organizations place introductions in the body of the report. The text reads as follows: This report presents international energy projections through 2035, prepared by the US Energy Information Administration, including outlooks for major energy fuels and associated carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>2. We provide our readers with a concise, one-sentence description of our report. The text reads as follows: The IEO2010 consumption projections are grouped according to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development membership.</p>
<p>3. An overview of how data are grouped in the report. The text reads as follows: The IE)2010 projections are based to the extent possible on the U>S and foreign laws, regulations and standards in effect at the start of 2010.</p>
<p>4. A statement of methods used to make projections. The text reads as follows: IEO2010 focuses exclusively on marketed energy. Non-marketed energy sources, which continue to play an important role in some developing countries, are not included in the estimates.</p>
<p>5. A statement of types of energy not included in this report. The text reads as follows: Objectives of the IEO2010 projections. Label: Because this &#8220;disclaimer&#8221; is so important, we placed it in a shaded box.</p>
<p>The labels read as follows:</p>
<p>Beginning at the bottom of page ix, we include a detailed advance organizer in these three paragraphs. The text reads as follows: The Generate World Oil Balance (GWOB) application is used to create a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; projections of world liquids supply- based on current production capacity, planned future additions to capacity, resource data, geopolitical factors and oil prices- and to generate conventional crude oil production cases.</p>
<p>This last paragraph includes more discussion methods. Do you think ending the preface with a paragraph on methods is effective?</p>

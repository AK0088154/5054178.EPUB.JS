<p class="noindent">The data that Department of Athletics staff members have collected can be confusing. Your job is to help organize and present the data to show the faculty and larger community that the department is focused on the academic success of its student-athletes as well as to help coaches and athletic administrators track academic performance and, if necessary, identify teams struggling in the classroom. This case asks you to analyze data on the academic achievement of several intercollegiate teams at a state college. You may be asked to do the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Evaluate the effectiveness of graphics to be used in a report published by the Department of Athletics.</li>
<li>Revise documents the department currently uses to communicate academic achievement scores to coaches.</li>
<li>Create graphics that highlight various teams&#8217; academic achievement to the faculty senate.</li>
<li>Create graphics and text for a press release that communicates the Department of Athletics&#8217; recent academic achievement to various stakeholders, such as campus administrators, faculty, and fans.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Your instructor will tell you which of the tasks you are to complete.</p>

<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Reflecting on This Case</b> In a 250- to 500-word response to your instructor, discuss (a) what you learned from this case, (b) how you could relate this case to work situations you will face in your chosen career, and, if applicable, (c) the ways in which this case compares to similar situations you have already faced at work. Your instructor will tell you whether your response should be submitted as a memo, an email, or a journal entry, or in a different format.</p>
<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Moving beyond This Case</b> Collect data for two different products within a specific category. For example, you might choose to research the nutritional values of two different energy bars, or you might investigate the features of two different video game consoles, the cost of living in two different towns, or the value of two different stocks. Using the data you collect, create the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>A graphic effectively showing that option 1 is the best choice.</li>
<li>A graphic effectively showing that option 2 is the best choice.</li>
<li>An unbiased graphic comparing the two options.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bx_noindent">Be prepared to explain the choices you made when selecting and presenting data as well as the rhetorical situations in which each of your graphics would be appropriate.</p>

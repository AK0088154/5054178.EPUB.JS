<p class="noindent">&#8220;Given some of the high-profile scandals at other institutions and recent news reports critical of intercollegiate sports in general, the faculty has become increasingly interested in how our student-athletes are performing in the classroom,&#8221; Cheryl explains. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to address our institution&#8217;s faculty senate next month. I have our most recent APR scores to illustrate the academic achievement of our student-athletes, but if I start going over a pile of statistics and using a bunch of acronyms, their eyes will glaze over and we&#8217;ll likely not make a good impression. I think the scores provide strong evidence that the entire Department of Athletics makes academics a priority. Having the support of our faculty is critical to our continued success, both in the classroom and on the field or court. Can you help me create some graphics that effectively communicate the academic success of our student-athletes?&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Cheryl would like to make the following two arguments in her appearance before the faculty senate: (1) based on APR scores, many Bayside student-athletes are above average academically compared to other Division I schools, and (2) based on the most recent APR scores, Bayside teams do better academically than many teams in their conference.</p>
<p class="indent">Cheryl hands you the APR statistics for both women&#8217;s sports (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch01_05.xhtml#fig_1_4"><b>Document 1.4</b></a>) and men&#8217;s sports (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch01_05.xhtml#fig_1_5"><b>Document 1.5</b></a>) in 2009&#8211;2010, the APR scores for conference schools in 2009&#8211;2010 (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch01_05.xhtml#fig_1_6"><b>Document 1.6</b></a>), and the APR scores for Division I schools in 2009&#8211;2010 (<a href="mun_9781457615023_ch01_06.xhtml#fig_1_7"><b>Document 1.7</b></a>) and asks you to create one or more graphics for each argument. &#8220;It would be a huge help,&#8221; she adds, &#8220;if you also suggested some speaking notes that I could use to introduce and explain each graphic to the faculty senate.&#8221; Based on the two points Cheryl wants to make, determine the data and type of graphics that will best help her persuade her audience. Then write speaker&#8217;s notes that will help Cheryl explain the graphics to her audience. When writing the speaker&#8217;s notes, consider whether Cheryl will need to provide some background information to senate members before they can understand the graphics of the institution&#8217;s APR scores.</p>

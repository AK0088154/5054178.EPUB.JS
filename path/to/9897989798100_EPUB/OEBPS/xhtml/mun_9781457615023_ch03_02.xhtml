<p class="noindent">This case requires that you put yourself in the reader&#8217;s shoes. Consider how a reader would respond to the content, design, and tone of the correspondence. Likewise, this case requires you to think about the purpose of each piece of correspondence: what does the writer want his or her reader to know, do, or believe as a result of reading the response? You must then find the best strategy for achieving the writer&#8217;s purpose.</p>

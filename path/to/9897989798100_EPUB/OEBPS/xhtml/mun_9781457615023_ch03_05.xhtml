<p class="noindent">Onward &amp; Upward Outfitters recently received a complaint (<b><a href="#fig_3_3">Document 3.3</a></b>) from a customer who had purchased H<sub>2</sub>O Pro-TechT rain gear. The sales specialist who originally helped the customer volunteered to write a response (<b><a href="#fig_3_4">Document 3.4</a></b>). Before mailing the response, Axel has asked you to examine the correspondence and report to him on the effectiveness of his staff member&#8217;s response. Study the claim and adjustment letters. Does the claim letter seem polite, reasonable, and specific? Is the response fair and reasonable? Revise the response letter. Write Axel an email in which you justify your revisions, and attach your revised response for his review.</p>

<p>Mr. Axel Geirsson</p>
<p>Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters</p>
<p>701 Butte St Boulder, CO 80301</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Geirsson:</p>
<p>On a recommendation from one of your sales specialists, Brook Rodney, I recently purchased a H2O Pro-Techt rain jacket (women&#8217;s medium). Brook told me that the H2O Pro-Techt was not only lightweight and packable but also waterproof.</p>
<p>Last weekend I accompanied my son&#8217;s Boy Scout troop on an overnight camping trip. As you probably know, it rained most of the weekend. When the dark clouds began to roll in while we were making camp, I didn&#8217;t much worry because I thought I had a waterproof rain jacket. I was wrong. The jacket just didn&#8217;t keep me very warm and dry. While the scouts completed their compass skills and other activities, I spent the entire weekend damp and cold. My son&#8217;s inexpensive PVC poncho kept him drier than my expensive &#8220;waterproof&#8221; jacket.</p>
<p>I feel that Brook misrepresented the features of the rain jacket (em dash) especially the waterproof feature. As a store advertising itself as a &#8220;place where the experts gear up,&#8221; I expected a much higher quality product. I would like a full refund of $157.43 (attached is a copy of the receipt) for the jacket. Before my family or the scout troop shops again at Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters, I need to be convinced that your products will hold up during our outdoor activities, including those in the rain.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Elise Smith.</p>

<p>Elise,</p>
<p>Referring to your letter dated May 17, I did not misrepresent the H2O Pro-TechT rain jacket. H2O Pro-TechT is the best breathable, waterproof rain gear available. I suspect you did not use the jacket properly.</p>
<p>H2O Pro-TechT, like all other waterproof/breathable fabrics, is not 100 percent waterproof and flawlessly breathable. However, you cannot find a better combination of water repellency and vapor transmission (sweat). Yes, PVC ponchos are inexpensive and certainly waterproof. However, they are heavy and bulky, not to mention extremely uncomfortable under just moderate exertion or outdoor temperature.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you spent the weekend cold and damp. First, you need to realize that H2O Pro-TechT is not a good insulator from the cold (wind yes, cold temperatures, no). It may be that you just need to wear a heavier, moisture-wicking layer underneath. On the other hand, you may have been wearing too much or a cotton fabric (remember, cotton kills) under the jacket. The dampness you felt may have been the sweat you built up while making camp. If this is the case, remember to use the ventilation zippers (pit zips) to allow your body heat and sweat to escape. You can check to see if your jacket does indeed leak by wearing it and standing in your shower or lawn sprinklers.</p>
<p>See you up there, Brook Rodney (Climbing Sales Specialist).</p>

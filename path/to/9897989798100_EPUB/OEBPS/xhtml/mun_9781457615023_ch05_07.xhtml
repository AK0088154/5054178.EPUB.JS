<p class="noindent">Merilee would like your help responding to two emails (<b><a href="#fig_5_12">Documents 5.12</a></b> and <b><a href="#fig_5_13">5.13</a></b>) from EIA analysts. Because the analysts follow the EIA&#8217;s <i>Web Editorial Style Guide</i> when writing reports, she wants you to consult relevant sections of the guide when responding to their queries. In both forwarded messages, she directs you to the appropriate sections of the guide.

<p>Subject: Doug Smith&#8217;s Preface Question</p>
<p>Because we discussed an EIA preface earlier this week, I thought you could help me. How do you think we should respond to Doug? I recommend you use the IEO 2010 preface as a model as well as information in the Web Editorial Style Guide, especially the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 12. E-mail me your response.</p>
<p>&#60;&#60;I&#8217;ve been asked to help write an upcoming report titled Trends in Renewable Energy Consumption and Electricity 2012. Because I haven&#8217;t written one of these reports before, I have been reading past reports. However, I&#8217;m having a hard time figuring out how to write the preface to the report. I&#8217;ve pasted below the preface to the 2009 report. I&#8217;d like to write a longer, more detailed preface and format it for our Web site. Would you suggest how to do so? Thanks. Doug</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports detailed historical data on renewable energy consumption and electricity annually in its report, the Renewable Energy Annual. This report, Trends in Renewable Energy Consumption and Electricity 2009, provides an overview and tables with historical data spanning as far back as 1989 through 2009, including revisions. These tables correspond to identical tables to be presented in Chapter 1 of the Renewable Energy Annual 2009 and are numbered accordingly. The renewable energy resources in the report include: biomass (wood and derived fuels, municipal solid waste (MSW) biogenic, landfill gas, ethanol, biodiesel and other biomass); geothermal; wind; solar (solar thermal and photovoltaic); and conventional hydropower. Hydroelectric pumped storage is excluded, because it is usually based on non-renewable energy sources. Prior editions of this report may be found on the EIA Web site at www.eia.gov/renewable/annual. Definitions for terms used in this report can be found in the EIA&#8217;s Energy Glossary at www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm. General information about all the EIA surveys with data related to renewable energy and referenced in this report can be found here: www.eia.gov/survey.&#62;&#62;</p>

<p>Subject: Marilyn Johnson&#8217;s Table Questions</p>
<p>Marilyn needs help formatting a fairly simple table. Before you assist her, refer to the Web Editorial Style Guide, which discusses footnotes and notes in Chapter 11 and hypertext links in Chapter 12. You also might want to read Chapter 8 on abbreviations. E-mail me your responses to Marilyn&#8217;s questions as well as a revised table reflecting your suggested revisions.</p>
<p>&#60;&#60;The attached table is part of the report Short-Term Energy Outlook I&#8217;m writing up for publication on the Web. I&#8217;m relatively new around here, and I&#8217;m still learning the EIA style. I need some help formatting my footnotes, notes, and hypertext links. Don&#8217;t worry about understanding the science (em dash) I need your help getting it to look right. I have some specific questions:</p>
<p> 1. I want to include the following footnotes: (1) West Texas Intermediate, (2) Average regular pump price, (3) On-highway retail, and (4) U.S. Residential average. Where should they go? I also want to include hyperlinks to our EIA online glossary (www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm) for terms used in footnotes 1 and 3.</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;d like to include the source of my data (Short-Term Energy Outlook, September 2011) and include a hyperlink to the full report. How should I go about doing this?</p>
<p>3. I&#8217;ve used superscript 1 and italics to indicate projected prices in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Cheers, Marilyn&#62;&#62;</p>
<p>A table shows Energy Sources for the years 2010-2011 and the projection for the years 2012-2013. The data from the table are given below:</p>
<p>Row 1: WTI Crude (1), ($/barrel); 2010- 61.65; 2011- 79.40; 2012 (superscript 1) - 94.40; 2013 (superscript 1) - 94.50.</p>

<p>Row 5: Natural Gas (4); 2010- 12.12; 2011- 11.19; 2012 (superscript 1) - 11.23; 2013 (superscript 1) - 11.87.</p>
<p>Row 6: Electricity (4), (cents/kilowatt hour); 2010- 11.51; 2011- 11.58; 2012 (superscript 1) - 11.84; 2013 (superscript 1) - 11.92.</p>
<p>Superscript 1- Prices are projections based on current data</p>
<p>Caption reads &#8220;Table 1. Price Summary of Major Energy Sources for 2010&#8211;2011 and Projections for 2012&#8211;2013.&#8221;</p>

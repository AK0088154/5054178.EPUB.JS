<p class="noindent">After proposals are submitted and distributed to reviewers, they must be quickly read and evaluated. Then a consensus must be reached on which proposals should be funded and which should be rejected. This can be a daunting process when dozens of proposals, each hundreds of pages in length, must be reviewed. Consequently, clear, concise, and easy-to-read proposals&#8212;in other words, <i>reviewer-friendly</i> proposals&#8212;improve an organization&#8217;s chances of being funded. Your challenge, the same one all reviewers face, is to identify the proposals that have the best chances of furthering the <i>funding source&#8217;s</i> goals.</p>

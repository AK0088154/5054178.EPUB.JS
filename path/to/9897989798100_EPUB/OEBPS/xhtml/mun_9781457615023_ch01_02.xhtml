<p class="noindent">Organizations often collect a wide variety of data on organizational performance, and they manipulate these data in numerous ways. This results in a mass of information that must be organized and transformed before the data can be used for a specific purpose. The data-collection process may seem foreign at first, and you may need to do further research at the organization or on the Internet to understand the numbers. Your challenge is to avoid becoming overwhelmed by the amount of data you must analyze and to instead discover ways to identify, manage, and present the data that are applicable to your task while ignoring what is irrelevant.</p>

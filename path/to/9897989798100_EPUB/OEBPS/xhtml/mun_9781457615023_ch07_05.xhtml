<p class="noindent">Burt shows you printouts of three slides (<b><a href="#fig_7_5">Documents 7.5</a></b> to <b><a href="#fig_7_7">7.7</a></b>) used during an earlier in-house presentation to the Office of Group Insurance staff. &#8220;I threw these together for a quick staff meeting earlier this year. I&#8217;d like to use these in the Open Enrollment presentation, but I don&#8217;t think the slides are clear enough for a general audience. Now that I look at them again, I&#8217;d be embarrassed if people outside this office saw them,&#8221; Burt confides. He then asks you to evaluate the effectiveness of the slides. Using presentation-graphics software, revise these slides so that Virginia state employees can quickly and easily understand the presented information.</p>

<p>The object area holds text and clipart. The text reads as follows: Concerns: Salary Issues- Respondents pointed to no across-the-board pay increases for the past three years and felt that their take home pay has been reduced as a result of premium increases each year.</p>
<p>Picking a Plan Design- Respondents feel they have limited choices and many don&#8217;t want to pay for services they don&#8217;t use.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals- There was a great deal of concern about the significant increase in out-of-pocket expenses if we switched from a co-payment plan to a co-insurance plan.</p>

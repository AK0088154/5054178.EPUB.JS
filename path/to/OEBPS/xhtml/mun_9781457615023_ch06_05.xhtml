<p class="noindent">Miranda shows you the engineer&#8217;s sketch of the touch-screen interface (<b><a href="#fig_6_3">Figure 6.3</a></b>) and a set of basic instructions for using the Priti5 (<b><a href="#fig_6_4">Document 6.4</a></b>). The final version of the Priti5 will have a touch-screen control panel rather than mechanical buttons and switches. The only exception is the on/off button. &#8220;I drafted instructions for when the machine is started. I think we should have these &#8216;start-up&#8217; instructions printed on the side of the monitor as well as in the user guide. What do you think?&#8221; Write Miranda an email evaluating the instructions and suggesting improvements.</p>

<p>Introducing the PRITI5 All in One Anesthesia Monitoring System, manufactured by Turnertronics Biomedical Systems!</p>
<p>Basic Instructions for Using the PRITI5 All in One</p>
<p>Since the advent of the PRITI monitoring systems (prior versions 1- 4), we have strived to include a wide range of options, allowing for optimal visualization and accurate data regarding any patient. In order for the anesthesia provider to interpret and implement various changes in the patient status, they must first be able to accurately analyze the data. By using the PRITI5 All in One, these tasks can be completed accurately and quickly due to the changes made in this new and upgraded monitor. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p>1. Verify all connections to electrical, oxygen, air and vacuum systems with the Biomedical department. Turn monitor on. The power button is located in the front of the machine on the right lower corner.</p>
<p>2. Attach monitoring devices to patient.</p>
<p>3. If using simulation equipment, attach at this time.</p>
<p>4. Select the patient type by touching the &#8220;more options&#8221; button at bottom of the monitor screen until the scroll-down selection appears and touch adult, pediatric, or neonate to set the monitor.</p>
<p>5. Verify that appropriate waveforms (em dash) waveforms are essentially pictures on the screen that depict different measurements of heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygenation at the capillary level, for starters(em dash) are present and accurate.</p>
<p>The upgrades to the monitor make it unique for use while monitoring an anesthetized patient having surgery, but can also be functional in any Critical Care Unit or Emergency Department.</p>
<p>Warning! Before using the monitor, the provider should review all attached materials and instructions included.</p>
<p>NOTE: Turnertronics is happy to provide one-on-one servicing of the PRITI5 All in One Anesthesia Monitoring System and recommends this be completed prior to use on patients.</p>

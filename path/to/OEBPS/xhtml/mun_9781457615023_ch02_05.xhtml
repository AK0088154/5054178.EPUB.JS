<p class="noindent">&#8220;I think some of the longer descriptions I plan to include miss their mark,&#8221; Jenny tells you, &#8220;but I&#8217;m unsure how to revise them. Could you take a look at four passages I&#8217;m having trouble with, identify the techniques I use, and then evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques? Please include revised passages.&#8221; She says she will attach the passages and her annotations to an email message (<a href="#fig_2_5"><b>Documents 2.5</b></a>, <a href="#fig_2_6"><b>2.6</b></a>, <a href="#fig_2_7"><b>2.7</b></a>, and <a href="#fig_2_8"><b>2.8</b></a>), and she would like you to respond by email. When you evaluate the passages, Jenny wants you to consider carefully the blog&#8217;s audience and the organization&#8217;s purpose for posting the information on the blog.</p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt002_004">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Everyone considers a bug to be a pest, right? Not so! There are actually insects that are beneficial to our environment&#8212;especially in the garden! Just what is a beneficial insect? A beneficial insect is an organic, natural pest control method that also has the ability to pollinate. They can reduce and even eliminate the need to use chemical pesticides that can be harmful and may not even work. Because they are organic, they are not harmful to the plants, people, or pets. Now keep in mind, they are not a miracle cure for all your garden woes, but you won&#8217;t encounter pesticide resistant pests if you utilize beneficial insects because there is no immunity to being eaten!</p>
<p>A black and white photo shows a ladybug.</p>
<p>So now what? Which insects are considered beneficial and what do they do? Below is a list of several types of beneficial insects that are safe, organic, and will do the work for you. Ladybugs (see pic): preys on aphids and mites; Minute Pirate Bug: preys on spider mites; Big Eye Bug: predator to mites; Assassin Bug: predator; Damsel Bug: preys on cabbage worms and aphids;</p>
<p>Soldier Beetle: consumes aphids, grasshopper eggs, caterpillars, also a minor pollinator;</p>
<p>Honey and Predator Bees: facilitate pollination, propagation, and fruit production, kill pests; Trichogramma Wasp: parasitizes the eggs of agricultural pest insects and easy to release in fields Others include spiders, preying mantis, scarab beetle and many more! Where can we find the beneficial insects for our personal use in the garden? Many occur naturally and we kill them ourselves because we aren&#8217;t aware of their capabilities and many are just plain frightened of them. Several are available for purchase at the local garden store or on the Internet. Search the keywords &#8216;beneficial insect&#8217;, identify what will work in your garden and make the purchase and let them get to work. Remember, it&#8217;s a bug eat bug world out there!</p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt002_007">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Picture yourself in ancient Roman times cultivating the soil yourself with hand tools and maybe even a plow and horse. Now picture yourself today doing the same manual labor in the garden. Yuck! Why not purchase a garden tiller and let it do the heavy work for you!</p>
<p>Just what is a garden tiller? A garden tiller is a motorized rotary plow that &#8216;tills&#8217; or cultivates the soil. Functioning independently (being operated by a human), or attached to a tractor (also operated by a human), the rotary blades continuously turn the soil providing easier access to nutrients and improving the soil structure for planting.</p>
<p>The garden tiller was in its initial stages of creation in 1912 by Arthur Clifford in Australia. By 1922, he found that it worked well and he established the Howard Rotavator Company, Ltd. The Rotovator is still in use today and is self-propelled, moving forward and backwards. Dr. Konrad von Meyenburg also created a &#8220;machine for mechanical tilling&#8221; in 1910 and Troy-Bilt followed much later with the &#8216;Rototiller&#8217; in the 1930&#8217;s. Nowadays there are literally hundreds of garden tillers available at your fingertips. Depending on the needs of your garden, how do you choose what will work? Here are a few simple hints to choosing a garden tiller.</p>
<p>A line art shows a garden tiller with the following parts numbered:</p>
<p>Handle- 112.</p>
<p>Stand- 111.</p>
<p>Engine- 116.</p>
<p>Gear Box-21.</p>
<p>Drag rod- 32.</p>
<p>A rod connecting the wheel and the fender rod- 25.</p>
<p>Wheel- 115.</p>
<p>1. Choose something easy to move and lightweight.</p>
<p>2. Choose either electric or gas powered.</p>
<p>3. Choose front or rear tined; front maintains already cultivated soil whereas rear is the workhorse of the garden for uncultivated soil.</p>
<p>4. Check the horsepower: increased HP for breaking up new ground and decreased HP for the casual garden.</p>
<p>5. Check the prices! There are lots of brand names and prices available. Consider what works best for you at the price you can afford.</p>
<p>Get to the garden and cultivate! </p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt002_005">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>So you have a garden and you want to prevent a common occurrence called erosion control. What is it? How do you prevent such a thing if you don&#8217;t really know what it is?</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;Do you think these questions help to frame the discussion that follows?&#8221;</p>
<p>Erosion control is the practice of preventing or controlling wind or water erosion in agriculture (em dash) for our purposes (em dash) gardening. This, in turn, is important to prevent water pollution and soil loss. Erosion control often involves the use of a physical barrier to absorb some of the energy from the force causing the erosion. Obviously we all can&#8217;t have an indoor greenhouse to protect from the wind or a barreling rainstorm, so you can utilize other forms of barriers, such as vegetation or rock. Fred Turner, master gardener, uses a raised platform bed (below) and rock barriers in the garden area.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;Should we include this mention of a local gardener&#8217;s erosion control method?&#8221;</p>
<p>Two black and white photos show raised garden beds.</p>
<p>There are many different items that may be used to prevent erosion control. Mulching is a great use of organic material that can cover the garden to protect it from erosion and provide nutrient as well. Perennial plants can also be used to buffer the surrounding areas of the garden. Other examples include, cellular confinement systems, contour plowing, bioswales, crop rotation, and reforestation. Not all of these would be prudent in the average home garden, but would be used in agriculture and urban landscaping.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;I&#8217;m undecided whether I like the more technical parts of this passage (e.g., cellular confinement and bioswales). I&#8217;m wondering if our readers would be interested in such detail. What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>So when you consider creating your garden and landscaping around it, consider what you need to prevent erosion control. Then, not only will the yard look good, you will have a thriving and fruitful harvest from the garden.</p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt002_006">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>The USDA Hardiness Zone map divides North America into 11 separates zones. Each zone is 10 degrees F warmer (or colder) in an average winter than the adjacent zone. Some of the zones are further divided into &#8216;a&#8217; and &#8216;b&#8217; categories&#8212;depending on the reference. Zone 8b skirts near the western and southern borders of the United States where the average climate has warm winters and a long growing season. The minimum temperature for Zone 8 ranges from 10-20 degrees F (-12.3 to -6.6 Celsius) and Zone 8b further delineates that range from 15-20 degrees F (-9.4 to -6.7 Celsius). Geographically speaking, certain plants are capable of growing better in certain climates and the Zone map strives to give the unknowing gardener a better idea of what will or will not grow, depending on the zone map. The USDA map is most esteemed in the eastern half of the country where the land is relatively flat and the zoning works well. There are, however, drawbacks to using the hardiness zones in the west. The map does not take into consideration summer heat levels or amount of snow cover in the winter. Weather coming from the Pacific Ocean becomes less humid as it crosses the mountain ranges in the west and becomes much dryer, so the climate in Seattle is very different than the climate in Bayside, but both are in Zone 8b.</p>
<p>A map, titled USDA plant hardiness zone map (for western USA mainland), shows annual extreme temperature zones across the United States. The states are categorized based on the following temperatures: Below -50 F, -50 to -40 F, -40 to -30 F, -30 to -20 F, -20 to -10 F, -10 to 0 F, 0 to 10 F, 10 to 20 F, 20 to 30 F, 30 to 40 F, Above 40 F.</p>
<p>So, what can you plant in Zone 8b? Lots of things! The Arbutus Unedo (strawberry tree), Choisya terhata (Mexican orange), and Olearia x haastii (New Zealand daisy bush) to name a few. If you have no idea of what those plants are, stick with the more common vegetables such as spinach, kale, onions, celery, broccoli and cauliflower. They are planted at different times of the year, so reference your favorite garden site for that information. Common fruits for Zone 8b include blueberry, raspberry, kiwi, grapes, and apples. You can even plant nuts in Zone 8b as well. Good choices would be almonds, pine nuts and pistachios. In the future, scientists and gardeners are working on revising the USDA Hardiness Zone Map to include recent changes in the climate. This may be even more helpful than the current map. For now, living in Zone 8b, creating a super fantastic backyard Bayside garden can yield some pretty tasty eats!</p>

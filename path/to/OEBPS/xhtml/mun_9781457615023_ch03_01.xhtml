<p class="noindent">Axel Geirsson, (<b><a href="#fig_3_1">Figure 3.1</a></b>), an accomplished adventurer who has twice reached the summit of Mount Everest, recently moved to the United States and opened a small climbing and outdoor specialty shop in Boulder, Colorado. Onward &amp; Upward Outfitters is focused on providing climbing enthusiasts with high-quality outdoor gear and apparel. It boasts an extensive selection of climbing hardware, harnesses, ropes, slings, helmets, and footwear. The store is staffed by an extremely knowledgeable team, yet Axel has noticed that his staff has some difficulty explaining technical concepts to customers who do not have extensive outdoor or climbing experience. &#8220;My staff from time to time gets caught up in the enthusiasm of helping customers prepare for outdoor adventures and assumes that customers already know the basics when, in fact, many do not,&#8221; Axel says. Consequently, some customers leave the store believing they know how to use their new equipment properly, only to be stranded miles from a mobile-phone signal, sometimes in the middle of the night or during a thunderstorm.</p>

<p class="indent">The staff&#8217;s occasional misjudgment of their customers&#8217; background knowledge has generated a few complaints. The staff can successfully address the concerns of those customers who return to the store or call to report a problem. However, customers who email or send a letter do not always get an effective response. Some disgruntled customers have begun posting critical comments on popular outdoor blogs and on microblogging sites like Facebook and Twitter. Rather than resolving customer problems, the store&#8217;s correspondence merely generates more problems. As a result, Axel has hired a public relations firm, which has assigned you, a communications consultant at the firm, to help Axel improve his store&#8217;s correspondence.</p>

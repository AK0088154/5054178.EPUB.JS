<p class="noindent">The Priti5 project manager, Miranda Gutierrez, wants you to learn about the potential users of the monitor and its features by interviewing various subject-matter experts &#8212; the engineers, sales representatives, and consulting anesthetists who best know the prototype and how it will be used. Miranda explains that these folks are busy and often do not recognize the importance of documentation. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need to convince them to take time away from product development, sales, or patient care to talk with you. You will also need to ask appropriate questions that won&#8217;t be seen as a waste of their time,&#8221; she explains. As an example of what not to do, Miranda hands you an annotated copy of an email (<b><a href="#fig_6_2">Document 6.2</a></b>) that she received from a person in another division whom she was not inclined to help. Consequently, she asks you to send her a draft of the email you will send to the SMEs to schedule an interview as well as the list of questions you plan to ask about audience, features, and medical terms. Working with two to three other students, brainstorm a list of questions about the Priti5 to ask each of the three different types of SMEs listed above, and then write the emails.</p>

<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>To: Miranda Gutierrez</p>
<p>Subject: Priti4.3</p>
<p>I just realized I need information about the Priti4.3 before I leave. (I assume you worked on the 4 series.) Can the 4 recognize the use of the anesthetic agent Isoflurane? Can the monitor display two different ECG leads? Also, tell me something about the 4&#8217;s other features. Jeff.</p>
<p>The labels read as follows:</p>
<p>The message projects the attitude that I exist solely to help Jeff.</p>
<p>The questions are flawed. By requiring only a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; response, Jeff won&#8217;t learn very much. Also, the last question is too broad.</p>

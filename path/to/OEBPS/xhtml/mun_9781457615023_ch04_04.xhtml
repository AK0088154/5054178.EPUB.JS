<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Contact Person: Sherilyn Baxter</p>
<p>Skyview Coalition</p>
<p>17 East Main Street</p>
<p>Boise, Idaho 83705</p>
<p>Problem Statement</p>
<p>Problem #1: We lack the funds to update our &#8220;Services Directory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Problem #2: We lack the funds to serve a specific health need in our community: money for prescription medications.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Goal #1: Update and distribute at least 100 copies of a new &#8220;Services Directory&#8221; by January 31, 2013.</p>
<p>Goal #2: Meet specific funding needs for prescription medications that would otherwise be unmet.</p>
<p>Program Description</p>
<p>The Skyview Coalition (SC) is a partnership of King County community service groups. The SC serves as the central meeting place for groups and agencies to gather and coordinate the health-related needs of persons in King County. It has been the traditional role of the SC to coordinate services to prevent any at-risk person from falling through the cracks. The problem with this approach has always been the lack of an easy way to set out in clear terms which agency provides what services. SC members worked together to prepare a printed &#8220;Services Directory.&#8221; This directory allowed people to locate services by category of need (for example, shelter, health care, etc.) This directory needs updating.</p>
<p>We also help persons who do not qualify for any type of assistance with the cost of prescription medications. In past years, we have been funded on a limited basis by the Renzo Foundation.</p>
<p>However, our funding has evaporated when community need has sharply risen.</p>
<p>Budget Justification</p>
<p>Goal #1: Cost of supplies for new services directory:</p>
<p>Letter sized copy paper; 10 reams @ $9.00 plus tax, shipping; $107.20.</p>
<p>Copy machine toner cartridge; 1 plus tax, shipping; $120.17.</p>
<p>Three-ring binders; 100 @ $3.50, plus tax, shipping; $378.67.</p>
<p>Labels for binder covers; 5 packages @ 3.99 plus tax, shipping; $25.45.</p>
<p>Section dividers; 100 packages @ 2.99 plus tax, shipping; $332.99.</p>
<p>Total: $965.</p>
<p>Goal #2:</p>
<p>Prescription medication funding:</p>
<p>Prescription funding; 3 months; $1000.00.</p>
<p>Total: $1000.00.</p>
<p>Note: This grant would by used for three months of prescription funding, and would allow us time to regroup. Overall Total Grant Request: $1,965.00.</p>

<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Contact Person: Marc Heidelburg</p>
<p>Rehabilitation Unit</p>
<p>State Children&#8217;s Hospital</p>
<p>3402 Valley Road</p>
<p>Garden Valley ID, 83704</p>
<p>The Problem: The Rehabilitation Unit (a.k.a. Rehab) at State Children&#8217;s Hospital (SCH) is a sixteen bed extended care unit. Pediatric physical rehabilitation hospital wards train children who have been severely and permanently disabled to learn to live as active a life as each of them can and to varying extents, reincorporated them back into the mainstream of life. Most of these kids have closed head type injuries and/or spinal cord damage secondary to serious trauma and therefore need constant medical supervision that can only be achieved with long term hospitalization.</p>
<p>The Solution: Gameday Brigade proposes to orchestrate a &#8220;Take me out to the ballpark day&#8221; for the kids in Rehab, and those parents who would like to share in the event. The event is a field trip for the kids in Rehab at SCH to our town&#8217;s minor league home baseball game.</p>
<p>My Approach: Marc Heidelburg (me) is an individual is not an employee of or permanently associated with State Children&#8217;s&#8217; Hospital. I have a BS in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology from the State University where I graduated Magna Cum Laude. I am in my final semester of the Master&#8217;s in Chemistry program at SU. Furthermore, I am a former Pediatric Rehabilitation Volunteer at Skyview Teaching Hospital and a former medical student form the State College of Medicine.</p>
<p>How the Heathcoat-Lynn Foundation Can Help: With the demonstrated commitment you organization has shown to making heath care possible for all community members, I am requesting approximately $500 to cover admission for the children, the support staff, and interested parents. If you approve this proposal request, I will use it as the foundation upon which to seek support from local businesses. Your consideration of this proposal project is greatly appreciated. On behalf of the Rehab children, thank you.</p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt004_004">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Contact Person: Robin Collins</p>
<p>Community Outreach, Recreation, and Education (CORE) Center</p>
<p>125 Weeping Willow Lane</p>
<p>Kuna, ID 83704</p>
<p>Need</p>
<p>In 2011, there were 136 live births to women, ages 15-19 in King County. The total population of women ages 15-19 in King County was 1,458 that year. One out of ten teenagers became parents in King County in 2010. Many teen parents have not had the opportunity to develop parenting skills which are essential to the health, safety, and education of their children. The Community Outreach, Recreation, and Education (CORE) Center has developed a Teen Initiative Plan (TIP) to deal with the problems of pregnant and parenting teens in King County.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>Through the CORE Center, the King County Health Department and the Sweetwater School System have collaborated to provide prenatal care to pregnant teens at local schools. The State Department of Human Services has coordinated with the Health Department and the Sweetwater School System to develop an on-campus day care program for teen parents who are still in school. In addition to the day care, the CORE Center will provide TIP classes to teen parents whose children are enrolled in the on campus day care center.</p>
<p>Approach</p>
<p>The TIP parenting classes will be required of teen parents whose children are enrolled in the on-campus day care program. The classroom program will be designed to:</p>
<p>&#8226; Teach the importance of good nutritional habits and preventative health care</p>
<p>&#8226; Teach the importance of child safety</p>
<p>&#8226; Teach responsible decision making</p>
<p>&#8226; Teach the importance of education</p>
<p>A CORE Center member will coordinate speakers for the various topics and lead class discussion. Ideally, the class would be conducted by a certified teacher who would invite guest speakers through the CORE Center. The TIP class would be an elective course for the student.</p>
<p>Budget Justification</p>
<p>1 &#8211; 32" LCD HDTV DVD Combo; $408</p>
<p>1 &#8211; Cart for Flat Panel TV; 100</p>
<p>Parenting Textbooks; 450</p>
<p>50 pupils textbooks</p>
<p>3 teacher guides</p>
<p>10 Classroom DVDs; 550</p>
<p>Teaching aids; 300</p>
<p>Total Grant; 1,808.</p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt004_005">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Contact Person: Eric Glenn</p>
<p>State College Student Services</p>
<p>3476 Sam Peck Drive</p>
<p>Boise, ID 83704</p>
<p>Situation</p>
<p>According to the Idaho Traffic Collision 2011 Report, 26,241 traffic collisions totaling $1.6 billion occurred in 2011. Drivers between the ages of 20 and 34 represented a major percentage of drivers involved in those traffic collisions. Although they comprised 27% of all licensed drivers, they accounted for 34% of all collision-involved drivers and 35% of drivers involved in fatal or injury collisions. Indeed, traffic officers issued 154,649 traffic tickets in 2011. Half of the traffic violations were basic rule/speeding violations.</p>
<p>For most students, being involved in a traffic collision is depressing. The consequences of these matters vary from affecting grades to dropping out of school. Most collisions are avoidable; therefore I want to try to introduce a two-hour Defensive Driving Course (DDC) offered at eight different times for State College students.</p>
<p>Goal</p>
<p>The goal of the DDC is to improve students&#8217; driving skills.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Teach four workshops each spring and fall semester. All students are welcome, but students who often have traffic collisions or violation tickets will have priority. The best way to illustrate the concepts of defensive driving is through hands-on driving exercises. To keep costs low, we will use a combination of discussion and video instruction. DDC is not new to Idaho. Many state employees attended an approved DDC during the past three years. After taking the DDC, state employee accident rates have declined, resulting in lower liability premiums for state agencies.</p>
<p>Budget</p>
<p>Each DDC will cost $220 ($1760 for all eight workshops). The cost covers instructor honorariums, course materials, audio-visual equipment fees, refreshments, and advertising.</p>
<p>Benefits Conducting the DDC at State College will be a benefit to everyone in King County:</p>
<p> &#8226; Enhance participants&#8217; life and safety skills</p>
<p> &#8226; Reduce the human tragedy and property loss caused by motor vehicle accidents</p>
<p> &#8226; Increase the number of safe drivers in the county.</p>

<p class="noindent">Being able to learn new material quickly is an important job skill for technical communicators, who often work on new product lines or on projects involving the contributions of a variety of experts. Like many nonprofits, BUGS recruits volunteers with a variety of interests, including people with writing and technology skills to support the educational programs. Most BUGS volunteers commit to working at least 10 hours per month as program instructors or in the BUGS garden. As the first volunteer with a strong background in writing, you will spend most of your time helping improve the program materials and writing content for the Web site. Because you might not have much experience with gardening or blogging, your challenge is to research and learn new terminology and then clearly explain these terms to the young gardeners.</p>

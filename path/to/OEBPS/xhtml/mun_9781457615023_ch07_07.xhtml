<p class="noindent">The presenters for the open enrollment meetings will be Abbey McLean and Liana Anderson. They have decided that they would like to supply attendees with a handout. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to merely print our presentation slides. We&#8217;d like a brief handout that focuses on our 2011 enrollment numbers, the difference between the new PPO and our traditional plans, benefit provisions, plan costs, and our contact information.&#8221; From her smartphone, Abbey e-mails you the plan costs and their contact information (<b><a href="#fig_7_9">Document 7.9</a></b>). Create a handout that can be printed on a single sheet of standard paper.</p>

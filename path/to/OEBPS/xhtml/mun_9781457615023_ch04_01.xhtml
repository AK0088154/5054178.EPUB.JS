<p class="noindent">The Heathcot-Lynn Foundation is a charitable organization established in 2008 with assistance from the estate of Drs. Heathcot and Lynn Turner. Its mission is to provide a pool of philanthropic capital to fund a variety of wellness and prevention programs in Idaho. In 2011, the foundation awarded a total of $14,000 to seven nonprofit projects in Boise, McCall, Caldwell, and Weiser. Foundation recipients in 2011 included community-sponsored clinics, a domestic violence crisis line, a school-based childhood obesity program, and a tobacco-cessation program for hospitalized patients.</p>
<p class="indent">As a new social media intern, you are responsible for developing content for the foundation&#8217;s Web site, blog, microblog, and other social-networking sites. To familiarize yourself with the foundation&#8217;s work, you have been asked by the board of directors to review proposals submitted to the foundation. The vast majority of the foundation&#8217;s awards address four goals:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>To encourage innovative health and safety programs</li>
<li>To improve the way health and safety services are provided to at-risk groups</li>
<li>To foster collaboration among health and safety providers</li>
<li>To support the teaching of healthy lifestyles</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">To help you evaluate each submission, the board of directors has given you the following evaluation criteria:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><i>Need for the project.</i> Does the proposal describe specific gaps or weaknesses in health or safety services?</li>
<li><i>Goal.</i> Does the proposal clearly describe what the project will accomplish?</li>
<li><i>Project approach.</i> Does the proposal describe an effective method for accomplishing the goal?</li>
<li><i>Cost.</i> Can the project be accomplished with the proposed budget? Are all budget items justified in the proposal?</li>
<li><i>Impact.</i> If successful, who will benefit, and to what extent?</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The board has also provided you with an example (<b><a href="#fig_4_1">Figure 4.1</a></b>) of a winning proposal from last quarter. Included are brief comments from the reviewers.</p>

<aside class="hidden" id="alt004_001">
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Contact Person: Shirlee Williams</p>
<p>King County Senior Center Health Program</p>
<p>823 Pershing Drive</p>
<p>Boise, ID 83704</p>
<p>Project: Breast Self-Examination (BSE) Outreach Program.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads as follows: Need for project: Although a spelling error in the first sentence concerned some reviewers, all agreed that the writer uses quantitative data (for example, numbers and percentages) from a credible source to establish the project&#8217;s importance. The problem statement relates the project to foundation goals and uses survey data to suggest that the Senior Center is a strong candidate to conduct the project.</p>
<p>Problem Statement</p>
<p>According to the American Cancer Society, one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and two-thirds of those women will be over 50. Although most breast lumps are discovered by women themselves, only 35% practice monthly breast self-exams (BSE). However, if the cancer is detected early (localized), the five-year survival rate is 96% compare to 75% if the cancer has spread regionally.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a need to educate and encourage the high-risk group (women over 50) to perform monthly BSE. According to the Avon&#8217;s Breast Cancer Awareness Crusade survey, more than half of the women surveyed said they would be more motivated to get mammograms and clinical breast exams if encouraged by people close to them and 40% name volunteers from health programs among the group of motivators.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>1. Educate the high-risk population in King County about breast cancer and train them to perform BSE.</p>
<p>2. Conduct twenty BSE workshops with at least twenty-five attendees per workshop.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;Goals: Succinctly explains what the project will accomplish by identifying the target population, indicating the project&#8217;s scope, and describing project events.&#8221;</p>
<p>Approach</p>
<p>Our strategy for achieving our goals is the following:</p>
<p>&#8226; Publicize BSE workshops through civic organizations, church groups, retirement homes, senior centers, press releases, newsletters, and flyers.</p>
<p>&#8226; Hold BSE workshops in conjunction with Breast cancer Awareness Month (October).</p>
<p>&#8226; Use facilities at the Senior Center and volunteer health educators to teach workshops.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;Approach: Approach is effective, covering publicity plans, the project&#8217;s timing, and cost-savings activities. Also demonstrates how the project will educate the target population by describing the content of the BSE workshops.&#8221;</p>
<p>BSE workshops will cover the following topics:</p>
<p>&#8226; Why do BSE (statistics, benefits, excuses)?</p>
<p>&#8226; When to do BSE (body cycles &#38; types, frequency of BSE)</p>
<p>&#8226; How to do BSE (breast model kits, diagrams, shower cards).</p>
<p>Budget</p>
<p>A table shows Item, Notes, and Cost.</p>
<p>The data from the table are given below:</p>
<p>Row 1: Publicity; Flyers, mailings, newspaper ads; $200.</p>
<p>Row 2: Workshop Materials; Breast model kits (4), education kits (2); 500.</p>
<p>Row 3: Participant Materials; 500 handouts, shower cards, BSE pads; 1,800.</p>
<p>Row 4: Refreshments; Soda @ $1 x 25 participants x 20 workshops; 500.</p>
<p>Row 5: Total: $3,000.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;Cost: Uses a three-column table to clearly present a reasonably detailed budget. Dollar amounts are accurately totaled. Reviewers felt $500 was excessive for refreshments and not directly related to the project&#8217;s goals. As a result, the project was awarded $2,500.&#8221;</p>
<p>Impact</p>
<p>Achieve a higher percentage of early detection of breast cancer among participants in the King County high-risk group who perform BSE with a resulting higher survival rate due to earlier treatment and follow-up care.</p>
<p>The corresponding label reads &#8220;Impact: Although wordy, this section clearly aligns the project with the foundation&#8217;s goals by stating how a King County at-risk group will be taught a healthy lifestyle skill that will likely increase the group&#8217;s survival rates.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">&#8220;Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t fund all the deserving proposals we receive,&#8221; explains Jessica Bureau, the president of the foundation&#8217;s board. &#8220;The recent economic <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" title="39" id="page39" />downturn has resulted in a tenfold increase in requests for funding. However, the board has allocated no more than $3,000 for awards this quarter. We want you to recommend which projects should be funded. When making award decisions, you may decide to fund a project fully, partially, or not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">Although the staff at Onward &amp; Upward Outfitters are expert climbers, they need your assistance improving their company&#8217;s correspondence so they can provide better customer service. You are asked to use your background in communication to analyze correspondence surrounding a particular rain gear product sold by Onward &amp; Upward Outfitters. You may be asked to do the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Evaluate and revise the company&#8217;s internal memo.</li>
<li>Examine a customer&#8217;s claim letter, and revise the corresponding adjustment letter.</li>
<li>Respond to two claim letters.</li>
<li>Write one to three microblog posts and a blog post addressing a common customer complaint.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Your instructor will tell you which of the tasks you are to complete.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can view case documents at the bottom of each task below.</p>

<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Reflecting on This Case</b> In a 250- to 500-word response to your instructor, discuss (a) what you learned from this case, (b) how you could relate this case to work situations you will face in your chosen career, and, if applicable, (c) the ways in which this case compares to similar situations you have already faced at work. Your instructor will tell you whether your response should be submitted as a memo, an email, or a journal entry, or in a different format.</p>
<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Moving beyond This Case</b> In small groups, brainstorm a list of instances in which group members purchased a defective product or received poor service. Then choose one of these instances and work together to write either a polite, reasonable claim letter or a blog post designed to attract the attention of a company representative and get the problem resolved.</p>

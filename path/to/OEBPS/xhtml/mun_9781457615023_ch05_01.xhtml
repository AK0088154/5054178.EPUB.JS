<p class="noindent">You have accepted a technical-communication internship at the Washington, DC headquarters of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA, the statistical and analytical agency of the U.S. Department of Energy, provides data and information on energy sources. The EIA publishes reports, Web products, press releases, databases, and maps. Publications are issued weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, and as needed or upon request.</p>
<p class="indent">As an intern, you will work closely with Merilee Summerfield, a technical publications editor. &#8220;Our Web site is the primary communication channel for the EIA,&#8221; Merilee explains. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just launched the first phase of a comprehensive site redesign that will affect the way we write Web content. Using a uniform style throughout our site tells users that the EIA has high standards for our content and our data.&#8221; She has asked you to develop Web content and to help scientists as they write various EIA documents.</p>
<p class="indent">When writing Web content, EIA writers follow recommendations from <i>The Energy Information Administration&#8217;s Web Editorial Style Guide</i> (<a href="#fig_5_1"><b>Figure 5.1</b></a>). The guide specifies details of the writing style required by the EIA, including rules for punctuation, word usage, tone, and hypertext links. The guide also contains direction on matters related to EIA work specifically, such as editorial voice, capitalization of frequently used words and terms, abbreviation of units of measure, and notes.</p>

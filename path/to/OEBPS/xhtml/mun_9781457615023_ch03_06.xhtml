<p>It&#8217;s called foul (fowl) weather, and that&#8217;s what we were caught in this weekend. That breathable rain gear you sold us last week failed us. Sure, H20 PRO (em dash) WHATEVER works if you&#8217;re standing still not doing any physical exercise, but your claim that the rain gear we purchased was breathable enough to keep us dry from sweat while we&#8217;re actually hiking in three season conditions is just FALSE. There was an upside, however. At least the rain gear helped retain our body heat, even if we were drenched with sweat instead of rain, so being wet and warm is better than being wet and cold. IMHO your rain gear just doesn&#8217;t work. While it was raining, we found a better solution: it&#8217;s just better to keep that &#8220;high tech&#8221; rain gear you sold us inside our packs and get drenched and just hike with a t-shirt. My wife just hiked in one of those sport shirt bra type things and was OK most of the time. Then when we got to camp we put that &#8220;high tech&#8221; rain gear on to retain some body heat. I know you won&#8217;t give us our money back, so how about sending us some &#8220;high tech&#8221; t-shirts to wear when it rains?</p>
<p>Not holding our breath, Rick &#38; Kim Hart.</p>

<p>To: Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters</p>
<p>Subject: H20 Pro-TechT Raingear&#8217;s poor performance</p>
<p>Dear Onward &#38; Upward Outfitters:</p>
<p>Since you opened your shop, I have purchased several pieces of outdoor equipment from you. I have always been impressed with your friendly and knowledgeable staff as well as your high-quality gear that doesn&#8217;t let me down when I need it. Recently, I purchased the H2O Pro-TechT ultralight waterproof jacket (#568870) and pants (#651932).</p>
<p>This weekend I got a chance to &#8220;field test&#8221; my new rain gear. Unfortunately, I spent most of my trip wet and cold. My shirt was soaked only a few hours after I put on the jacket. I couldn&#8217;t tell if the seams were leaking or if the jacket just didn&#8217;t &#8220;work.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know that H2O Pro-TechT is relatively new. Am I the only one who has had problems with the H2O Pro-TechT rain gear? As I trudged along the trail, I kept thinking maybe I was just unlucky and bought a defective set of rain gear. If I brought my rain gear back, would you be willing to take a look at them? And, if nothing seems wrong, may I return the rain gear? I don&#8217;t want to spend another day in the rain like I did this weekend.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Jeff Collins.</p>

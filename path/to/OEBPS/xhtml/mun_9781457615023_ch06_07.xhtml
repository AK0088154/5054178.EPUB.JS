<p class="noindent">One of the project engineers, Terry Saussol, stops you in the hall and suggests that online training would be more effective than a user guide alone. &#8220;Anesthetists could watch a brief &#8216;how-to&#8217; video to support the information in the user guide.&#8221; After a brief conversation, you tell Terry that you will create a mock-up of the online training. E-mail Terry your plan for the online training for the instructions you wrote in Task 3. Include thumbnail sketches of the visuals, as well as a script of the audio component of the training. In your script, remember to include notes indicating when each visual should appear, when animated elements should start and stop (e.g., new text appearing, an arrow pointing to a waveform, etc.), directions to the speaker (e.g., when the speaker should emphasize specific content, pause, etc.), and any other notes that will help the technicians and speaker produce this training.</p>

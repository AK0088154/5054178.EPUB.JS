<p class="noindent">While discussing some of the organization&#8217;s printed educational materials and planned blog posts with you, Jenny remarks, &#8220;I&#8217;m a little concerned about how wordy our blog might appear. Our young gardeners just won&#8217;t read dense text. I&#8217;m sure we could add some visual interest and reduce the text-heavy feel, but I&#8217;m just not sure where to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Because BUGS participants are just beginning to learn gardening terminology, Jenny explains that she would like to use graphics as well as text in some of the posts. She asks you to review <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_5"><b>Documents 2.5</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_6"><b>2.6</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_7"><b>2.7</b></a>, and <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_8"><b>2.8</b></a> and evaluate whether the proposed graphics would clarify and complement the text. If you decide that the proposed graphics are not suitable, or you determine that additional graphics would help, suggest alternatives. In an email to Jenny, describe how one or more graphics would help, and describe how to best integrate the graphics with the text. Remember that these graphics will be displayed online in a blog post.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, Jenny would like to convert some of her blog posts to handouts for use with various BUGS programs. Select one of the descriptions in <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_5"><b>Documents 2.5</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_6"><b>2.6</b></a>, <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_7"><b>2.7</b></a>, and <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch02_05.xhtml#fig_2_8"><b>2.8</b></a>, and design a one-page color handout suitable for printing and distribution at BUGS educational programs. You will likely need to further develop the description and locate suitable graphics.</p>

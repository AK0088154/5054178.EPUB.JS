<p class="noindent">The success of this new interactive blog depends on the young gardeners&#8217; understanding the definitions and descriptions. If they cannot understand a gardening term or a blog feature, they may give up on their backyard gardens or fail to make use of the blog. Your job is to analyze the site&#8217;s audience and purpose and then help the BUGS blogger explain backyard gardening and blogs. To prepare the blog for its launch, you may be asked to do the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Analyze parenthetical and sentence definitions.</li>
<li>Evaluate and revise descriptions.</li>
<li>Identify where a graphic would help clarify and complement a written definition or description.</li>
<li>Write several definitions and descriptions for gardening terms that young people might not know.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Your instructor will tell you which of the tasks you are to complete.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can view case documents at the bottom of each task below.</p>

<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Reflecting on This Case</b> In a 250- to 500-word response to your instructor, discuss (a) what you learned from this case, (b) how you could relate this case to work situations you will face in your chosen career, and, if applicable, (c) the ways in which this case compares to similar situations you have already faced at work. Your instructor will tell you whether your response should be submitted as a memo, an email, or a journal entry, or in a different format.</p>
<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Moving beyond This Case</b> Write a 500- to 1,000-word description of a piece of equipment or a process used in your field. Include appropriate graphics. On a separate sheet, briefly describe your audience and the purpose of the document in which your description would likely appear.</p>

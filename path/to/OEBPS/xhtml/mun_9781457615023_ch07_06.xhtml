<p class="noindent">One important decision state employees must make during the open enrollment period is whether to choose a traditional or PPO health plan design. Because the state has never offered a PPO plan, Burt wants to answer the questions, &#8220;What is a PPO plan, and how does it work?&#8221; Consequently, he has decided not only to discuss this at the meetings but also to create a brief online presentation with audio to accompany the slides. &#8220;Although we will discuss this topic at the open enrollment meetings, I want an online resource available to state employees who either can&#8217;t make the meeting or need a refresher before they select a plan next month,&#8221; Burt explains. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want a bunch of text-heavy slides for viewers to read. Instead, I want the presentation graphics and audio component to work together to provide a clear explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indent">Burt has e-mailed you his notes (<b><a href="#fig_7_8">Document 7.8</a></b>) describing what the presentation should cover. Create four to six slides, and write the script for the audio portion of the presentation. In your script, remember to include notes indicating when each slide should appear, when animated elements should start and stop (e.g., new text appearing, an arrow pointing to important content, etc.), directions to the speaker (e.g., when the speaker should emphasize specific content, pause, etc.), and any other notes that will help the technicians and speaker produce this presentation.</p>

<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>To make an informed choice between a traditional plan and a PPO, state employees need to understand what a PPO is. A Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) is a health plan with an established provider network (physicians, hospitals, labs, etc.) that has agreed to accept specific payment levels for specific services.</p>
<p>I want to make this point clear: A PPO is not a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). A PPO does not require you to select a Primary Care Physician (as in HMOs), and referrals are not required (as in HMOs). PPOs are an increasingly common plan offered by employers. One benefit of a PPO is that patients can &#8220;self-refer&#8221; themselves to specialists without having to get a referral from their primary care physician (PCP). You just make an appointment with the specialist. In a PPO, you are free to select any healthcare provider. If your physician is in the PPO network, you will have lower deductibles, a higher reimbursement of expenses, and the lowest possible out-of-pocket expense. If enrolled in a PPO and your physician is not in the PPO network, you will experience a higher deductible, a lower reimbursement level for expenses, and a higher annual out-of-pocket maximum limit.</p>
<p>As part of this conversation on PPO plans, I&#8217;d like to summarize the FY2012 plans for the audience. (The following applies to both the traditional and PPO plans.) Pharmacy benefits as well as Dental and Vision are unchanged. New for FY &#8242;12 is a premium category (Employee + Spouse + Single Child). The flexible spending account (FSA) limit has been increased from $2,500 to $3,000, the Integrated Behavioral Health Plan (IBHP) In-Patient Co-payment has been increased to $15, and Outpatient Co-payment has been increased to $25. Finally, enhanced Wellness Benefits and Well Baby Nursery Benefit are part of both plans.</p>
<p>For the traditional plan, employee premiums will increase by 15%, traditional plan benefits are unchanged (with the exception of the addition of Wellness and Well Baby Nursery Benefits), and co-insurance is unchanged at 80/20 of allowable charges (that is, the insurance carrier pays for 80% of the allowable charges and the employee pays for the remaining 20%).</p>
<p>For the PPO plan, the network is slightly smaller than the traditional network, monthly premiums and deductibles are less than the current FY &#8242;11 traditional insurance plan, the co-payment is $20 for physician office exams with in-network physicians, and the co-insurance is 85/15 of allowable charges (in network) and 70/30 out-of-network.</p>

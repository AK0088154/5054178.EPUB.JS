<p class="noindent-top">As the documentation specialist on the project, you will need to analyze your audience and devise a way to show them how to use the new monitor correctly. Using the engineers&#8217; notes, you will start writing the step-by-step instructions for the Priti5 prototype. After being introduced to the project, you may be asked to do the following:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Plan an interview with a subject-matter expert (SME).</li>
<li>Analyze an engineer&#8217;s notes, and evaluate a set of instructions.</li>
<li>Use an engineer&#8217;s notes to write step-by-step instructions.</li>
<li>Develop an online training module for the monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Your instructor will tell you which of the tasks you are to complete.</p>

<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Reflecting on This Case</b> In a 250- to 500-word response to your instructor, discuss (a) what you learned from this case, (b) how you could relate this case to work situations you will face in your chosen career, and, if applicable, (c) the ways in which this case compares to similar situations you have already faced at work. Your instructor will tell you whether your response should be submitted as a memo, an email, or a journal entry, or in a different format.</p>
<p class="bx_noindent"><b>Moving beyond This Case</b> Locate a flawed set of instructions for a step-by-step procedure, and revise them so that the directions are more effectively communicated. Or write instructions for a procedure that does not have any but needs them. Shareware programs and free software often feature imperfect instructions or no instructions at all. Shareware sites (such as <a title="external" href="http://www.shareware.com">www.shareware.com</a>) might provide you with a good sample for this task.</p>

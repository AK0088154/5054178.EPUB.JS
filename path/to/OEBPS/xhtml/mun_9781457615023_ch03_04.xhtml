<p class="noindent">A few months ago, Onward &amp; Upward Outfitters began selling lightweight rain gear featuring a new thin, waterproof, breathable layer of fabric called H<sub>2</sub>O Pro-TechT. A few customers have complained that the rain gear seems to leak. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t think the fabric is defective. It&#8217;s just that our customers are not being properly educated about what they can expect from H<sub>2</sub>O Pro-TechT or how to care for the fabric,&#8221; Axel explains. He has addressed the situation by drafting a memo to store personnel (<b><a href="#fig_3_2">Document 3.2</a></b>) stating the store&#8217;s policy regarding H<sub>2</sub>O Pro-TechT apparel. Evaluate the effectiveness of Axel&#8217;s draft, and then revise it. Write Axel an email in which you justify your revisions, and attach your revised memo for his review. Axel also encourages you to improve the design of his draft.</p>

<p>MEMO</p>
<p>To: Onward &#38; Upward Staff</p>
<p>From: Axel</p>
<p>Date: May 25, 2012</p>
<p>As you know, we&#8217;ve been selling a lot of the H2O Pro-TechT product line. Unfortunately, we&#8217;ve also been getting customer complaints that the H2O Pro-TechT fabric leaks, leaves them damp, or leaves them cold. I don&#8217;t think the fabric is defective. The fabric is highly tested and undergoes strenuous quality checks. You&#8217;re not effectively educating the customers about what they can and cannot expect from H2O Pro-TechT.</p>
<p>H2O Pro-TechT is not a space suit. Water can and will get in. When discussing H2O Pro-TechT rain gear, remember to emphasize the following: most feelings of dampness are not the result of leaks but of sweat. Under exertion, humans produce a surprising amount of sweat. Customers can address this problem by using the ventilation zippers (i.e., pit zips), wearing moisture-wicking clothes underneath, and layering clothes.</p>
<p>When handling customer concerns, try to find out if the product is defective or if the customer did something to reduce the product&#8217;s performance. For example, did they wait until they were already wet before putting on the rain gear? Did they have the pit zips open and allow water in? What type of clothing were they wearing underneath? Cotton clothes could leave them feeling damp during exertion. Too much clothing might lead to overheating, sweating, and an impression that the gear leaks. How long have they had the gear, and have they washed it recently? Dirt, crud, and salt water reduce the effectiveness of H2O Pro-TechT. Sometimes a good washing will dramatically improve the performance of the gear.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If customers are concerned, they can bring the gear back and we&#8217;ll take a look at it. If the seams or other material look defective, we&#8217;ll exchange it for another. This is a good product&#8212;perhaps the best on the market. By taking just a few minutes to talk with customers, we can help them avoid common mistakes and get the most out of their gear.</p>
<p>Onward and upward! Axel</p>

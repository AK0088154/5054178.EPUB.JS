<p class="noindent">After serving as a social media intern at the foundation for a semester, you resign and accept a job as a technical writer for King County Public Safety Department. You learn that the department wants to start a program to supply safety helmets to children under the age of 16 who cannot afford them. You mention that the Heathcot-Lynn Foundation might be a good funding source and volunteer to develop a proposal. Your supervisor, Rene Johnson, takes you up on your offer and sends you an email with the information she has collected (<a href="#fig_4_6"><b>Document 4.6</b></a>). Using her notes and other sources, write a proposal suitable for submission. Also, in a reply message to Rene, briefly justify your rationale for including or omitting visuals.</p>

<p>Subject: Bicycle Helmet Proposal Notes</p>
<p>Thanks for agreeing to develop this proposal. With more than 1.7 million people every year in the United States suffering a traumatic brain injury (TBI), I think the best way we can help families address this serious public health issue is through education and prevention. To help you get started, I&#8217;ve included below some notes on the idea as well as some graphics you might choose to include in the proposal. I&#8217;m not sure if we should include visuals or if the ones I found are suitable. What do you think?</p>
<p>Thanks, Rene.</p>
<p>Although there is no federal law in the United States requiring bicycle helmets, King County adopted in 1997 a bicycle helmet law requiring youths 16 and under to wear an approved protective helmet. In fact, 14 states still have no state or local bicycle helmet laws.</p>
<p>In 2011, police officers in King County issued 205 tickets or warnings for helmet law violations. A common reason given by children for not wearing a helmet was that they did not own a helmet. Many also said they could not afford one.</p>
<p>We need to provide helmets to families who cannot afford them. If families cannot afford helmets, then they certainly cannot afford the medical bills if kids sustain head injuries. We could also give out &#8220;citations&#8221; to kids who are wearing helmets, encouraging</p>
<p>positive behavior. I&#8217;ve attached an example from the Norwood Police Department.</p>
<p>In 2011, 19 children under the age of 16 were hospitalized from bicycle-related traumatic brain injuries in King County. In fact, according to the Maine Bureau of Highway Safety, &#8220;More children, ages 5 to 14, go to hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with bicycles than with any other sport.&#8221;</p>
<p>We should give each police officer brochures to give to minors who are not using helmets. These brochures should emphasize the risks they are taking and encourage them to wear helmets. We could also educate kids on the proper way to wear a helmet (see my second and third attachments). Correctly worn, a bicycle helmet can reduce the chance of head injury by up to 85 percent.</p>
<p>The text reads as follows:</p>
<p>Police to issue coupons redeemable at fire or police stations for free helmets. Another option is to place a few helmets in each police vehicle so officers can hand them out right on the spot.</p>
<p>Approximately 8,500 children between the ages of 5 and 16 are living in King County today. Many already have helmets or can easily afford one, so we probably need funds for about 100 helmets. Need small, medium, and large helmets. Helmets need to be unisex in color and design.</p>
<p>If we can just get 100 children who otherwise would not wear a helmet to do so, we can make a difference. As more kids wear helmets, they&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s cool to wear a helmet.</p>
<p>Attachment 1: Norwood Police Citation; A black and white photo shows a citation copy. Attachment 2: Bicycle Helmet Fit; three illustrations show a man on a bike wearing a helmet. It shows the wrong and right ways of wearing a helmet. The first illustration shows the helmet being tilted backward. The second shows the helmet being tilted in the front. The third shows the right position of the helmet on the head.</p>
<p>Attachment 3: Bicycle Helmet Fit; four illustrations show a man wearing a helmet. The first illustration shows the helmet placed in a wrong position. The second shows the helmet being placed in a right position. The third illustration shows the biker holding the helmet and moving it upward. The fourth shows the belts and buckles of the helmet.</p>

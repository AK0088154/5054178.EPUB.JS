<p class="noindent">The Gulls Department of Athletics at Bayside State College fields 10 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I intercollegiate teams: five women&#8217;s sports (volleyball, tennis, golf, soccer, and basketball) and five men&#8217;s sports (tennis, golf, soccer, basketball, and water polo). The teams compete in the Metro Sports Conference. In addition to tracking the graduation rates and grade point averages of their student-athletes, the staff at the Department of Athletics uses academic progress rates (APRs) developed by the NCAA to measure the academic achievement of student-athletes at Bayside.</p>
<p class="indent">A team&#8217;s APR score reflects how successful its student-athletes are at maintaining their academic eligibility and whether they remain enrolled in school. To be academically eligible to compete, student-athletes must meet a certain grade point average and make steady progress toward their degree by passing a specific number of degree-applicable courses each semester. Because turnover of nonscholarship players on a team roster can be high and because these student-athletes have not signed an agreement to stay on the team or at the school, coaches have less influence over them. Consequently, the NCAA includes only students receiving athletically related financial aid when calculating APR scores.</p>
<p class="indent">Recently, Bayside calculated two APR scores for each team: a <i>multi-year</i> APR score that reflects academic performance and progress over four years and a <i>single-year</i> score that focuses on just one academic year. Although a multi-year score includes data from the past four academic years, it is referred to by the most recent academic year included. Similarly, a single-year score is labeled by the academic year from which the data was drawn. For example, a multi-year score for 2009&#8211;2010 includes data from fall 2009, spring 2010, and the three previous years, going back to fall 2006. A single-year score for 2009&#8211;2010 includes data only from fall 2009 and spring 2010.</p>
<p class="indent">The APR measures the academic achievement of teams each fall and spring using a point system (<b><a href="#fig_1_1">Figure 1.1</a></b>). Each student-athlete on scholarship earns one point if he or she stays in school and one point for being eligible to compete each term. Thus, a scholarship student-athlete can earn up to four points each year: two in the fall and two in the spring. A team&#8217;s <i>single-</i> and <i>multi-year</i> scores are calculated by dividing the total points earned (over one year or the past four years) by the total points possible and then multiplying the result by 1,000. For example, a team earns 34 points for the year out of a possible 36. The single-year <span epub:type="pagebreak" class="pagebreak" title="2" id="page2" />APR score for the team is 944 (34 divided by 36 = .944, which is then multiplied by 1,000). A perfect score for the year is 1,000. Teams with low APR scores face penalties, such as scholarship losses and restrictions on practice and competition.</p>

<p>The report reads as follows:</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Golf Single&#8212;Year APR</p>
<p>Row 1: Hamilton, Dana; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>Row 2: Prete, Nancy; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010:1.</p>
<p>Row 3: Shapiro, Andrea; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>Row 4: Padilla, Elsa; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>Row 5: Gearhart, Trisha; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>Row 6: William, Tiffany; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>Row 7: Paine, Mary; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>Row 8: Lee, Kim; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 1.</p>
<p>Row 9: Rush, Allison; Fall 2009: 2; Spring 2010: 2.</p>
<p>The Spring 2010 data of Prete, Nancy and Lee, Kim are highlighted.  The corresponding label reads as follows: In SP10 the golf team lost two points because two student-athletes were academically ineligible to compete. However, both of these students earned a retention point for returning to school that semester.</p>
<p>Row 10: Total;  Fall 2009: 18; Spring 2010: 16.</p>
<p>Row 11: Total Points Possible for 2009&#8211;2010: 36</p>
<p>Row 12: Total Points Earned for 2009&#8211;2010: 34</p>
<p>Row 13: Single&#8212;Year APR for 2009&#8211;2010: 944</p>
<p>A label reads as follows: The single-year APR score is calculated by dividing the points earned (34) by the possible points (36). The resulting number (.9444) is rounded to the nearest thousandths and then multiplied by 1000.</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Golf Multi&#8212;Year APR</p>
<p>Row 1: 2009&#8211;2010; Points Possible: 36; Points Earned: 34.</p>
<p>Row 2: 2008&#8211;2009; Points Possible: 36; Points Earned: 32.</p>
<p>Row 3: 2007&#8211;2008; Points Possible: 36; Points Earned: 36.</p>
<p>Row 4: 2006&#8211;2007; Points Possible: 36; Points Earned: 32.</p>
<p>Row 5: Total; Points Possible: 144; Points Earned: 134.</p>
<p>Row 6: Total Points Possible Past Four Years: 144.</p>
<p>Row 7: Total Points Earned Past Four Years: 134.</p>
<p>Row 8: Multi&#8211;Year APR for 2009&#8211;2010: 931.</p>
<p>A label reads as follows: The multi-year APR score is calculated by dividing the total points earned over the last four academic years (134) by the possible points (144). The resulting number (.93055) is rounded to the nearest thousandths and then multiplied by 1000.</p>

<p class="indent">Because of your current position as an intern with the Bayside State College Sports Information Office and your expertise as a technical communicator, the athletic director, Cheryl Mueller, has enlisted your help in preparing materials to communicate the recently released APR scores. In particular, she seeks your assistance in explaining APR scores, selecting relevant APR data, and presenting the information in ways that coaches, faculty, and community members will understand. Because APR scores track each team&#8217;s classroom performance, the scores can be used to gauge the commitment of the student-athletes and their coaches to academics, to measure a team&#8217;s academic improvement, and to compare a team&#8217;s academic performance to that of conference rivals. An athletic department with consistently high APR scores demonstrates that its teams are competitive in the classroom as well as on the field.</p>

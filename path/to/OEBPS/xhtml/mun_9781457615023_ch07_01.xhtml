<p class="noindent">You have recently been hired as a documentation and training specialist for the Virginia Office of Group Insurance, a government office that manages state employees&#8217; medical, dental, life, and disability insurance needs. The office&#8217;s mission is to provide for the negotiation, purchase, and delivery of the most competitive and cost-effective group-insurance programs for state employees and their eligible dependents. For one of your first assignments, you are asked to help the office inform state employees about recent changes to their health insurance and to provide information that will help them make informed decisions regarding their health coverage. Because Virginia is switching insurance carriers for the next fiscal year (FY), the office has been busy communicating to employees about the features and options the new insurance plans offer and how to best use the benefits.</p>
<p class="indent">To enroll with the new carrier, employees must complete a new enrollment form, which asks them to choose between a traditional plan and a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan and select an appropriate enrollment category (employee, employee plus spouse, etc.). They must also decide whether to enroll in a flexible spending account (FSA) for dependent-care and unreimbursed medical expenses. To best help employees make knowledgeable enrollment decisions, the Virginia Office of Group Insurance must clearly and effectively provide the information they need.</p>
<p class="indent">Open enrollment, the only time of the year employees may make changes to their health coverage, is approaching, and the office needs your help preparing a presentation. Open enrollment meetings will be held at several locations around the state during the month preceding the plan&#8217;s open enrollment period. State employees will receive an e-mail with details regarding the meeting at their specific job location (<b><a href="#fig_7_1">Figure 7.1</a></b>). These meetings will begin with an oral presentation and will conclude with a question-and-answer session.</p>

<p class="noindent">During a call, Jenny tells you, &#8220;Yesterday, I brainstormed a list of terms I think I will use in my early blog posts. I just sent you two emails with several definitions I wrote (<a href="#fig_2_3"><b>Documents 2.3</b></a> and <a href="#fig_2_4"><b>2.4</b></a>). I would like your feedback on whether the definitions are effectively written and appropriate for our BUGS audience before I use them in a post.&#8221; She adds, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to use the Internet to learn about any unfamiliar terms.&#8221; She then asks you to write an email in which you identify by letter the effective definitions, include revised versions of those that are flawed, and identify any terms that are not appropriate for the blog&#8217;s intended audience.</p>

<p>Subject: Definitions for your review</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like my first post to focus on &#8220;how to use this blog.&#8221; I&#8217;d like you to review these parenthetical definitions before I use them and let me know which are OK as written and which need work. For those definitions needing work, please include a revised version in your response. Also, if you think I&#8217;ve included a term that is too technical for our audience, let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jenny</p>
<p>Parenthetical Definitions</p>
<p>A. When people started sharing personal stories and comments on the Internet in the 1990s, these writings were called a Weblog (later just called a blog). Soon people could access the blogosphere (the Internet community of over 150 million public blogs) to read bloggers&#8217; observations on almost any topic of interest.</p>
<p>B. To understand what topics are posted most frequently, our tag cloud, a visual cloud of tags emphasizing the most frequent tags appearing in our blog, is a good resource. Located on the right sidebar and organized alphabetically, the bigger the word appears the more frequent the topic appears in our blog.</p>
<p>C. You&#8217;ll note on our index page (or index.html, a traditional file name for the page you are on currently) we provide a brief overview of BUGS and explain the purpose of our blog.</p>
<p>D. Blogopotamus: Not an alien creature but a very long, bloated blog post.</p>
<p>E. A form of audio broadcasting on the Internet typically using an MP3 format, podcasting, is like downloading and listening to music. However, rather than music, you listen to someone talk about a topic of interest such as organic gardening.</p>

<p>Subject: Definitions for your review</p>
<p>I just wanted you to look over some of these sentence definitions, too. I&#8217;ve included both blogging and gardening terms. I plan to link these pop-up definitions from a glossary page. Let me know which are OK as written and which need work. For those definitions needing work, please include a revised version in your response.</p>
<p>Thanks, Jenny</p>
<p>Blogging Definitions</p>
<p>A. Tags are, as the name suggests, tags used to categorize, label, and organize lots of blog content.</p>
<p>B. The archive, usually categorized by month, is where you will find a collection of previous posts to a blog.</p>
<p>C. Less susceptible to link rot, a permalink is a permanent link to a specific blog post even after it has been archived.</p>
<p>D. Plug-ins are a type of small computer code that add functionality and new features to a blog such as social networking plug-ins.</p>
<p>E. Rather than having to visit many blogs to check if a new post is available, a Web feed allows you to get regular updates from one spot when content is updated.</p>
<p>Gardening Definitions</p>
<p>F. Bedding plants (mainly quick and colorful annuals) are nursery grown and used for growing in beds.</p>
<p>G. A dibble stick is used by gardeners to makes holes in the soil for seeds or young plants.</p>
<p>H. A taproot (not all plants have a taproot) is a thick root (the part below the surface used to secure and nourish) that grows directly down (in most cases).</p>
<p>I. Scarification is what is performed when a seed&#8217;s shell is scratched or nicked in order to facilitate germination.</p>
<p>J. Hardpan: the impervious layer of clay (a naturally occurring aluminum silicate) lying beneath the top soil&#8212;one of the most difficult types of soil a gardener can have the misfortune to encounter in his or her backyard.</p>

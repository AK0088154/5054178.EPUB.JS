<p class="noindent">Learning to write in a new organization involves a learning curve. You will experience part of this learning curve when you are asked to quickly learn about the EIA and what represents consistent, correct, readable Web content within that organization. You will also have to grapple with unfamiliar content. As you study model documents, consider their audience and purpose, become knowledgeable about their contents, and familiarize yourself with the EIA&#8217;s <i>Web Editorial Style Guide</i>, you will learn how to adapt your writing to meet the specific needs of an organization.</p>

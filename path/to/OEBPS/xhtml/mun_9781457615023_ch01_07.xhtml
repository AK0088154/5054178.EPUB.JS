<p class="noindent">Each year, after APR scores are ready, the athletic director posts a press release on the department&#8217;s Web site highlighting the academic success of Bayside teams compared to other teams in the Metro Conference. This year, she asks for your help in creating the press release. &#8220;I want to call attention to the teams that are outperforming their conference foes in the classroom,&#8221; Cheryl explains. &#8220;I also want to help our fans understand how we are measuring academic success. Most people understand grade point averages, or GPAs. But few people outside of athletics understand APR scores.&#8221; She hands you an outline for a press release (<a href="#fig_1_8"><b>Document 1.8</b></a>) that is missing the important data for this year. &#8220;This is just a start. Because this will be posted on our Web site, you may use color graphics, but keep the paragraphs short for easy reading. Keep the release under 750 words, and include the Bayside logo and at least one other graphic.&#8221; Complete the press release, revising and reorganizing as necessary. You will need to consult <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch01_05.xhtml#fig_1_4"><b>Documents 1.4</b></a> and <a href="mun_9781457615023_ch01_05.xhtml#fig_1_5"><b>1.5</b></a> to gather any missing data. For more information on the development of APR scores, you may want to visit www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/academics and read &#8220;How Academic Reform Is Measured.&#8221;</p>

The most recent APR rankings provide evidence that our students strive for the highest possible level of achievement. I am proud to see our teams ranked among the very best in the nation in both academics and athletics. Congratulations to our student-athletes, our coaches, and faculty for a job well done.&#8221;</p>
<p>College President Dr. Catherine Asbury</p>
<p>&#8220;We take great pride in how our students perform in the classroom. The time we spend working with them on their academic progress really shows in these rankings. Success in the classroom has always been our top goal each year. When we succeed in the classroom and on the field, we know we have a successful overall program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gull Head Soccer Coach Peyton Brandt</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pleasure to work with such a dedicated group of student-athletes. Many of our fans don&#8217;t understand how many hours these students devote to their studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Associate Athletic Director of Academic Services Madison Larson</p>
<p>[Include near the end of the release who developed the APR, what it is used for, and how it is calculated.]</p>
<p>The APR was developed by the NCAA in 2004 to measure the academic progress and performance for athletic programs at its member institutions . . . .</p>
<p>The APR is determined by using the eligibility and retention for each student-athlete on scholarship during a particular academic year . . . .</p>
<p>The APR is calculated . . .</p>
